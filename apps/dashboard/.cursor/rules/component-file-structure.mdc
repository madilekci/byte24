description: Defines the file structure and naming conventions for React components.
globs: **/*
---
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Private Components: For components used only within specific pages, you can create a _components folder within the relevant /app subdirectory.
- Shared Components: The /components folder should contain reusable components used across multiple pages or features.
- Favor named exports for components
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Use declarative JSX
